# My R Inspired Kitchen

This is a cookbook made in R. Yes, a literal cookbook. Not one of those "Cookbook for R" types with "recipes" for R code to do fun stuff with data. This cookbook has recipes that you will actually want to whip up in your kitchen and consume to nourish your body. Why make this in R you ask. Why not? I enjoy R (it clearly has invaded all aspects of my life) and it was an amusing way to learn the `Bookdown` package.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
