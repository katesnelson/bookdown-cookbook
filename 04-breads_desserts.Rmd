It's all about that crispy, crunchy crust! Replace the water with beer for a nice, mild beer flavor.

1. Dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of the water (lukewarm).

2. Mix all ingredients together in a stand mixer until the dough is smooth and elastic.

3. Let rest in an oiled container overnight or at least until doubled in size.

4. Gently shape into a round, trying to retain as many air holes as possible. Place on a baking tray dusted with semolina flour. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out and let rise for ~45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the over to 500$^\circ$.

5. Bake at 500$^\circ$ for ~25 minutes. Pour 1 cup of hot water into the bottom of the oven when placing the bread in the oven. Do not open the oven door for at least 15 minutes to allow the steam from the water to help create the crispy crust.

## Desserts {.unnumbered}

### Creamy cheesecake {.unnumbered #cheesecake}

Delicious, creamy, cheesecake with more protien and less fat. 'Nough said.

::::{.blackbox data-latex=""}

- 2 packages **greek** cream cheese *(I find this has better flavor, texture, and mouthfeel than Neufatchel cheese and like it just as much, if not more than, full fat cream cheese.)*
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 tbsp vanilla
- 1/4 tsp salt

::::

Beat cream cheese and sugar until well mixed and cream cheese is soft and fluffy. Add eggs and salt and mix until fully incorporated. Add cream and vanilla and blend until smooth. Pour into a 12 inch nonstick springform pan with a prebaked shortbread or crumb crust. Bake at 300 for ~45 minutes. Let cool completely before serving. Fantastic with warm rhubarb or plum compote.
